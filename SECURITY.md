# Security Policy

## Introduction
This document outlines the security measures and practices that should be followed while working on the side-quest-prototype repository. It is essential to maintain a high level of security to protect both the codebase and the users.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it directly to the repository owner by contacting them at [owner's contact method].

## Security Practices
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly check and update dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews:** Ensure all code is reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information such as API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them.
- **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Use secure methods for user authentication (e.g., OAuth) and authorization.
- **Monitor for Security Breaches:** Regular monitoring for unusual activities or breaches should be established.

## Best Practices for Developers
- **Use Strong Passwords:** All accounts related to this project should use strong, unique passwords.
- **Limit User Access:** Access to the repository should be granted on a need-to-know basis.
- **Regular Security Training:** Developers should undergo regular training on security best practices.

## Compliance
This project aims to comply with relevant security standards and regulations, including but not limited to GDPR and HIPAA, as applicable.

## Conclusion
Maintaining security is everyone's responsibility. Let's work together to keep the side-quest-prototype repository secure!
